# Jamp: Controlled Japanese Temporal Inference Dataset for Evaluating Generalization Capacity of Language Models

## About Jamp and this repository

**Jamp** is the Japanese temporal inference benchmark. This repository consists of templates, test data, and training data. The test data and training data both include tokenized and non-tokenized data. Tokenized data contains `wakati` in the file names. The training data contains both non-split data that includes all problems and split data following the methodology described in the paper. Files containing `template`, `time format`, or `time span` in their names are split based on **tense fragment**, **time format**, or **time span**, respectively.
